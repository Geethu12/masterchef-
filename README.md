Instructions
Rinse both the rice varieties together for a couple of times.
Soak both the regular rice, parboiled rice in water for 4 to 5 hours.
Drain and then add them to the grinder. Also add the grated coconut, cooked rice or poha (aval or flattened rice), dry active yeast, salt and sugar.
You can also proof the yeast separately and then add. Just take about 2 to 3 tbsp warm water. Add a pinch of sugar and dissolve it. Then add the yeast and stir. Let this solution sit at room temperature for 10 to 15 mins till it becomes bubbly and frothy. * Check notes
Add required amount of water and grind all the ingredients to a smooth flowing batter
Pour the batter in a large bowl or pan. Cover and keep aside for fermenting for 8 to 12 hours, depending on the temperature conditions.
The batter will rise and increase in volume the next day.
Heat a kadai or an appam pan with handles. Smear some oil on the kadai. If using non stick kadai, then skip smearing the oil.
Spread a ladle full of the batter. Turn and tilt the pan so as to spread the batter.
Cover the pan and let the appam cook. The base would become nicely light golden.
Make all appam this way.
Serve the appam hot or warm with vegetable stew or sweetened coconut milk.



Notes
*If using coconut milk for grinding the rice, then keep a check on water. You may not need to add water or add very less amounts.
* If using a yeast proofed solution, then add it to the batter once its ground finely. Stir and mix very well.
* If the batter become too thin, then add some rice flour to it.
